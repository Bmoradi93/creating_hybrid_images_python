# creating_hybrid_images_python
In this repository I'm supposed to dive into image filtering and one of its interesting application in creating hybrid images. At the very first step, an image filtering function has been developed from scratch accepting an image and a Gaussian filter kernel as its inputs. The second step was to write another function (from scratch again ) to generate hybrid images. This function uses the developed image filtering function accepting two relevant images and the Gaussian filter kernel as its inputs. Also, given that a Gaussian filter is provided for us, but as an interesting part of this assignment, a faction has been developed to create a Gaussian filter kernel from scratch. This way one is able to simply understand the whole idea behind the provided filter.
